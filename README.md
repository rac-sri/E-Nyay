- Witness can give their statement from their home/any safe place while the prisoner’s statement can be recorded from the prison.
- A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IS SPEND WHEN INMATES ARE TRANSPORTED EVERY YEAR FOR COURT HEARINGS. OUR PROJECT WILL SAVE AROUND MILLIONS.

- The police fir and the medical report will be availaible prior to the judges.
